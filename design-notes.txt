		  parrot - make a script with python

This code is based on the python I used for Buffy Season 2, hopefully
with some enhancements, and also with changes to cope with the
differences in the HTML used to typeset the Season 6 scripts.

The initial git checkin is frob.py from Buffy Season 2, and I've
slowly added things to it - at some point I'll throw away the old
functions. 

There is a problem that lines are sometimes (never?) delimited by
line-breaks, and other times by <br> (or <p>) [or the same,
upper-case]. The thing to do may be to load chunks of the file into
memory, re-line-break on <{p,P,br,BR}>, and then run through that
array. 

Current State:

ord_list() returns the correctly-ordered paths to each episode's HTML
first_pass(x) returns the title of x (which should be a path), and
will also return a list of probably-parts
make_lines(f) splits f (to EOF) into "lines", i.e. ignoring \n and
instead breaking where there is <{p,P,br,BR}> [UNFINISHED]
