		  parrot - make a script with python

This code is based on the python I used for Buffy Season 2, hopefully
with some enhancements, and also with changes to cope with the
differences in the HTML used to typeset the Season 6 scripts.

The initial git checkin is frob.py from Buffy Season 2, and I've
slowly added things to it - at some point I'll throw away the old
functions. 

Current State:

* ord_list() returns the correctly-ordered paths to each episode's HTML
* first_pass(x) returns the title of x (which should be a path), and
will also return a list of probably-parts
* make_lines(f) splits f (to EOF) into "lines", i.e. ignoring \n and
instead breaking where there is <{p,P,br,BR}>
* guess_parts(lines) looks for parts (identified by being all-upper-case
strings before : in a line

Parts:

We need to know which parts are different in each episode
(e.g. vampires), and which are common either across the series or in
linked episodes (which is essentially 1+2 and 21+22)

Also, we need 3 forms of each part:
i) cast-list form (e.g. Ms. Lefcort)
ii) this is their line form (e.g. MS. LEFCORT)
iii) LaTeX-safe-command-name form (e.g. MSLEFCORT)

...and to know which parts don't appear in the cast-list (e.g. Giles
voice-over)
