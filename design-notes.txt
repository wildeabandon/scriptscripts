		  parrot - make a script with python

This code is based on the python I used for Buffy Season 2, hopefully
with some enhancements, and also with changes to cope with the
differences in the HTML used to typeset the Season 6 scripts.

The initial git checkin is frob.py from Buffy Season 2, and I've
slowly added things to it - at some point I'll throw away the old
functions. 

Current State:

* ord_list() returns the correctly-ordered paths to each episode's HTML
* first_pass(x) returns the title of x (which should be a path), and
will also return a list of probably-parts
* make_lines(f) splits f (to EOF) into "lines", i.e. ignoring \n and
instead breaking where there is <{p,P,br,BR}>
* guess_parts(lines) looks for parts (identified by being all-upper-case
strings before : in a line
* gen_castlist(): calls first_pass on each episode in turn, generates
a list of each episode, in turn being a title,cast tuple. Writes out a
master cast-list file (contains each part only once)
This is a bit lame, in that it fails to sort the big parts properly -
* deal with this using emacs on casting.txt :)
*gen_partarrays(): creates Part objects for every part, and produces
three arrays of parts. Also pickles these to disk
*get_partarrays(): either loads the pickles, or calls gen_partarrays()
*fix_parts(): this applys some fixes to the members of the allparts
and partsbyep arrays, and then re-saves the new Pickle. We'll need to
comment out fixes once applied, to avoid attempted
multiple-applications.


Class Part:
 contains a list of appearances, whether this is really multiple parts
 (e.g. vampire 1), whether this is a real part or e.g. a voiceover

Class EpCount:
 excends tuple - lets you sort by x[0], which should be an int.

Parts:

We need to know which parts are different in each episode
(e.g. vampires), and which are common either across the series or in
linked episodes (which is essentially 1+2 and 21+22)

Also, we need 3 forms of each part:
i) cast-list form (e.g. Ms. Lefcort)
ii) this is their line form (e.g. MS. LEFCORT)
iii) LaTeX-safe-command-name form (e.g. MSLEFCORT)

...and to know which parts don't appear in the cast-list (e.g. Giles
voice-over)
