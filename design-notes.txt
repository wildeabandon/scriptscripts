		  parrot - make a script with python

This code is based on the python I used for Buffy Season 2, hopefully
with some enhancements, and also with changes to cope with the
differences in the HTML used to typeset the Season 6 scripts.

The initial git checkin is frob.py from Buffy Season 2, and I've
slowly added things to it - at some point I'll throw away the old
functions.
